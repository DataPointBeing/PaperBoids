# Hello!
This is my (Ed Carrotta's) submission for the agent-based simulation assignment.

This is a Boids implementation using small animated paper airplanes, with a breeze added to cause
their flight to be biased in a common direction.

To try out the simulation, load the scene in the Content folder and press play. The Boids will
begin flying within a few seconds; before they do, a small folding animation plays, during
which time the rate of velocity updates is heavily reduced to cause the Boids to assume a
chaotic starting arrangement before flocking behaviors fully begin.
